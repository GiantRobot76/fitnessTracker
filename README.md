# fitnessTracker

Objective of this exercise was to take existing front end code for a fitness tracking app and write the necessary server side code to enable a user to add exercises (both cardio and resistance) with specified paramaters. This was accomplished through the implementation of a Mongo DB. 

Finished app was deployed via heroku at the following link:
